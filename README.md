# Pytato
Work in progress: This is supposed to be a skill based python course. The documents have been prepared by the use of [doconce](https://github.com/doconce/doconce). All modules can be found in the [pub](https://github.com/ahiorth/Pytato/tree/master/doc/pub/) directory. The modules can be read as pdf, html or interactive Jupyter Notebooks.
