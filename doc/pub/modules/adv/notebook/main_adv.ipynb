    "# Running Python files from command line\n",
    "So far we have used notebooks to write Python code. Jupyter notebooks ends with an extension `.ipynb`, and if you open them in a text editor like notepad or emacs it does not look like it does in your web browser. On the other hand you can also write Python code in files that have an extension `.py`, then you would typically use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. In the `.py` files you cannot write markdown text. Sometimes it can be advantageous to use Python files and not Jupyter notebooks, the notebooks can take time to open and then you have to manually execute the cells you want to run.\n",

    "4. download data from the web or a server\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing you have to do is to write your code in a suitable editor and save it, if you use Visual Studio Code or Spyder you can of course run the Python file in the editor. Next, you open the anaconda power shell, use `cd` to move where your Python file is located and write"

    "# Mutable and immutable objects\n",
    "What we have explained in the previous section is related to what is known as mutable and immutable objects. These terms are used to describe objects that have an internal state that can be changed (mutable), and objects that have an internal state that cannot be changed after they have been created. Example of mutable objects are lists, dictionaries, and arrays. Examples of immutable objects are floats, ints, tuples, and strings. Thus if we create the number 10 its value cannot be changed (and why would we do that?). Note that this is *not the same as saying that*  `x=10` and that the internal state of `x` cannot change, this is *not* true. We are allowed to make `x` reference another object. If we do `x=10`, then `x is 10` will give true and they will have the same value if we use the `id` operator on `x` and `10`. If we later say that `a=11` then `a is 10` will give false and `id(a)` and `id(10)` give different values, but * `id(10)` will have the same value as before*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable objects, and once a list is created, we can change the content without changing the reference to that object. That is why the operations `x=[]` and `x.append(1)`, does not change the id of x, and also explain that if we put `y=x`, `y` would change if `x` is changed. Contrary to immutable objects if `x=[]`, and `y=[]` then `x is y` will give false. Thus, whenever you create a list it will be an unique object.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**A final tip.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are bound to get into strange, unwanted behavior when working with lists, arrays and dictionaries (mutable) objects in Python. Whenever, you are unsure, just make a simple version of your lists and perform some of the operations on them to investigate if the behavior is what you want.\n",
