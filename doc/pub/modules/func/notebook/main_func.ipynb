    "As explained in the introduction, a function is several lines of code that perform a specific task. In many ways you can think of a function as a recipe, e.g. a cake recipe. To make a cake we need a certain input, eggs, flour, sugar, chocolate, then we follow a specific set of operations to produce the cake. A function in Python operates in the same way, it takes something as input (different variables), follow certain steps and returns a product (the cake).\n",

This also explains that if you use the `np.append(x,some_value)` inside a function where `x` is large it could slow down your code, because the program has to delete `x` and create a new very large box each time it would want to add a new element. A better way to do it is to create `x` *large enough* in the beginning, and then just assign values `x[i]=a`."

    "## Mutable and immutable objects\n",
    "What we have explained in the previous section is related to what is known as mutable and immutable objects. These terms are used to describe objects that have an internal state that can be changed (mutable), and objects that have an internal state that cannot be changed after they have been created. Example of mutable objects are lists, dictionaries, and arrays. Examples of immutable objects are floats, ints, tuples, and strings. Thus if we create the number 10 its value cannot be changed (and why would we do that?). Note that this is *not the same as saying that*  `x=10` and that the internal state of `x` cannot change, this is *not* true. We are allowed to make `x` reference another object. If we do `x=10`, then `x is 10` will give true and they will have the same value if we use the `id` operator on `x` and `10`. If we later say that `a=11` then `a is 10` will give false and `id(a)` and `id(10)` give different values, but * `id(10)` will have the same value as before*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable objects, and once a list is created, we can change the content without changing the reference to that object. That is why the operations `x=[]` and `x.append(1)`, does not change the id of x, and also explain that if we put `y=x`, `y` would change if `x` is changed. Contrary to immutable objects if `x=[]`, and `y=[]` then `x is y` will give false. Thus, whenever you create a list it will be an unique object.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**A final tip.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are bound to get into strange, unwanted behavior when working with lists, arrays and dictionaries (mutable) objects in Python. Whenever, you are unsure, just make a simple version of your lists and perform some of the operations on them to investigate if the behavior is what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we show some ``unexpected\" behavior, just to demonstrate that it is easy to do mistakes and one should always test code on simple examples."
