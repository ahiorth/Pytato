    "## Why should you learn programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick google search will tell you that you should learn to code because it will lead to job opportunities and boost your career. This is almost certainly true. I would highlight that it will let you test out ideas much more efficiently. When you have a lot of domain knowledge of a certain phenomena, you will most likely have ideas that can lead to innovation. As an example, maybe you have observed something that makes you believe that phenomena that most people think are unrelated actually are related. To prove or support you claim you need to collect data from these phenomena and present them together. Since the phenomena are unrelated the data are most likely located different places. With some basic knowledge of Python you can easily access different files, folders, web pages, scrap data from them, filter the data and visualize them. Furthermore as you are using a computer program there will be much less manual errors. The first step in any data exploratory phase is usually to make some plots and look for patterns visually. The next steps is quantify correlations by e.g. regression analysis or to use more advanced machine learning techniques. Using Python it is almost trivial to get started, it takes of course time to master, but with basic Python knowledge you can easily run through tutorials yourself and become quite advanced within weeks."

    "\n",
    "The aim of this course is to start with practical applications and gradually move to basic operations. We choose a top-down approach, because we hope it will be more engaging. Thus, we will start with some advanced features and move to basic programming concepts. What we want to do is to get some useful applications up and running fast, and then investigate from a programming perspective what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the consequence that we will introduce basic programming concepts such as types, lists, dictionaries *when it is needed, and only the minimal amount of information*. The challenge with this approach is that there is always more to learn about the basic programming concepts, thus if you feel that you would like to know more about the different concepts you should explore this on your own. See the next section for where to find resources."

    "# Online programming resources\n",
    "This course is supposed to be self contained, but there are of course plenty of online courses, youtube videos, and books that you should take advantage of to improve your understanding. These resources are extremely valuable if you know exactly what your are looking for. As a complete beginner with little or no knowledge of Python it can be confusing if you do not know what you are looking for. Great online sources that cover much of Python basics are [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), and [A Whirlwind tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/). These resources explains quite briefly important concepts and give examples, such as\n",

    "2. Install an integrated development environment (IDE). An IDE is simply where you write the Python code. After installing Anaconda you should already have Spyder installed, if not you can install it by opening the Anaconda Navigator. You will find the Anaconda Navigator in the start menu in the Anaconda folder, but most likely there will already be a program called Spyder in your program folder. Another IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or VS Code for short, see [figure 1](#fig:intro:ide) for two examples. An IDE will help you to write code, because it will give information about the code you write and also help you to find errors.\n",

    "Here we have collected stuff that will make your life easier, and increase the speed of understanding. We have tried to explain some concepts below, if this is too little information there are plenty of online resources that you can check out. The purpose of this section is to introduce you to some concepts that are key to any programming language, but can take some time to master or to get under your skin. If you understand these concepts, coding will be easier. Do not focus on how we use these concepts in coding, that is what the course is all about, rather try to understand the meaning of the concepts."

A function in Python operates in the same way, it takes something as input (different variables), follow certain steps and returns a product (the cake).\n",

    "In Python everything is an object. An object is a variable (a box) that contains data and functions. That means that the boxes in [figure 2](#fig:intro:var) is more than just  pieces of memory. To continue the with the recipe example above, we can think of an object as a cookbook that also contains ingredients, in Norwegian ''Matkasse'' or in English a ''Meal Kit''. There will be many recipes in this meal kit and many ingredients. In Python the syntax for accessing the functions (recipes) or data (ingredients) is by using the `.` syntax. In [figure 1](#fig:intro:ide), this is illustrated. When we write `x='This is a string'`, we can e.g. do `x.capitalize()`, which will (not surprisingly) transform all the small letters to capital letters, `'THIS IS A STRING'`.\n",

In many ways you can say that objects are physical whereas a class is logical. For the food kit case a class can be a description of the food kit on paper, describing how many recipes, how much potatoes, meat etc. should be included in each food kit, whereas all the food kits delivered to the customers are the objects."
