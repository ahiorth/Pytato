    "\n",
    "You will for sure not master Python in two days, but you will be able to perform many useful tasks, and lay the foundation for further development. In particular with the release of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login), I would say it has never been so easy to get advanced applications up and running with only a basic understanding of Python. If you manage to formulate what your task precisely, then ChatGPT will translate your request into code (see e.g. [figure 1](#fig:intro:chat1)). This is clearly not foolproof, the code you get back might not work exactly as you want and you will need to modify it, or perhaps you have to break your task into several smaller pieces to get useful answers from ChatGPT (or the web) and then you are left with the task of gluing them together yourself."

    "## Why should you learn coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick google search will tell you that you should learn to code because it will lead to job opportunities and boost your career. I would also highlight that it will let you test out ideas much more efficiently. When you have a lot of domain knowledge in a certain area, you will most likely have ideas that can lead to innovation or new insight. As an example, maybe you have made some observation indicating that two phenomena originally believed to be unrelated, actually are related. To prove or support you claim, you would then need to collect data from these phenomena and present them together. Since the phenomena are unrelated the data are most likely located in different places. With some basic knowledge of Python you can easily access different files, folders, web pages, scrap data from them, filter the data, and join them. Once you have collected the data you would then make some plots, and inspect the plots to discover patterns. The next steps is to quantify correlations by e.g. regression analysis or to use more advanced machine learning techniques. All this can be achieved with Python, it will take you time to master this fully, but with basic Python knowledge you can easily run through tutorials yourself and become quite advanced within weeks."

    "This has the consequence that we will introduce basic programming concepts such as types, lists, dictionaries *when it is needed, and only the minimal amount of information*. The challenge with this approach is that there is always more to learn about the basic programming concepts, thus if you feel that you would like to know more about the different concepts you should explore this on your own.

Another IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or VS Code for short, see [figure 2](#fig:intro:ide) for two examples.

To continue the with the recipe example above, we can think of an object as a cookbook that also contains ingredients, in Norwegian ''matkasse'' or in English a ''meal kit''. There will be many recipes in this meal kit and many ingredients. In Python the syntax for accessing the functions (recipes) or data (ingredients) is by using the `.` syntax. In [figure 2](#fig:intro:ide), this is illustrated.
