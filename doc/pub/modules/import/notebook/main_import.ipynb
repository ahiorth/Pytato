    "It is always hard decide which coding language to learn, it usually depends on what you want to do. If you want to do very fast numerical calculations Fortan or C used to be the most popular languages, and for web or application programming Java. However, in recent years Python has become more and more popular, one of the reasons is its large amount of libraries and communities. If you have an idea of what you want to do, you can almost be certain that there exist a Python library written for that purpose. In the next chapters we will cover some advanced operations in Python and use them to motivate to learn more about the basic operations.\n",
