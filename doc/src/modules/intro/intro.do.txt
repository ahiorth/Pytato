======= Introductory Remarks =======
The aim of this course is to start with practical applications and gradually move to basic operations. Thus, we are actually reversing "traditional" Python courses that would normally start by defining basic programming concepts and move into advanced concepts. There is nothing wrong with this, but it would require quite some time of Python coding before you would be able to do something advanced. What we want to do is to get to useful applications fast, and then you would have to learn more about the basic operations on your own.
