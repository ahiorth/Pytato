======= Introductory Remarks =======
The aim of this course is to start with practical applications and gradually move to basic operations. Thus, we are actually reversing "traditional" Python courses. A traditional Python course would normally start by defining basic programming concepts and move into advanced concepts. There is nothing wrong with this, but it would require quite some time of Python coding before you would be able to do something advanced. What we want to do is to get some useful applications up and running fast, and then investigate from a programming perspective what is going on.

======= Online programming resources =======
There are plenty of online courses, youtube videos, and books. The If you have never coded before, there is a very good  programmed a
